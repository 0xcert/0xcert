## Simple Summary

A digital asset is described by its own 0xcert convention.

## Abstract

A digital asset in the 0xcert protocol is defined in form of a specifically designed JSON object. Every data object has its own convention which follows the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) specification.

## Motivation

To simplify the process of describing digital asset as data objects and to enable interoperability between different applications 0xcert provides a convention for each digital asset.

Anyone can propose a new convention by opening a new [issue](/issues). The proposal is accepted and merged into master branch as soon as the interested community approves it based on the majority consensus.

## Specification

A digital asset in the 0xcert protocol is defined and described in form of a specifically designed JSON object, which conforms to [RFC-7159](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and follows the mapping format defined by the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) specification.

Every digital asset in the 0xcert protocol has its own JSON Schema definition. The schema represents a technical specification of a particular digital asset, which explains the JSON data object structure and a detailed description of each data key.

The naming of JSON properties follows the [schema.org](http://schema.org/) specification when possible. This is to enable an easy way to convert a digital asset data object into [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format. The convention also expects the JSON keys to be defined in alphabetical order.

Schemas are versioned according to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification. If new fields are added to the schema and it stays backward compatible then the schema version should not change.

## Example

Digital asset data object:

```json
{
  "familyName": "Smith",
  "givenName": "John"
}
```

Digital asset JSON Schema definition:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "description": "Imaginary digital asset.",
  "id": "https://specs.0xcert.org/schemas/1/1-0-0-asset",
  "properties": {
    "familyName": {
      "description": "Family name. In the U.S., the last name of a Person.",
      "type": "string"
    },
    "givenName": {
      "description": "Given name. In the U.S., the first name of a Person.",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "title": "ImaginaryAsset",
  "type": "object"
}
```
