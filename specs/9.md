## Simple Summary

The protocol minter allows trustless minting of Xcert tokens directly to a recipient.

## Abstract

The protocol minter uses a combination of an off-chain agreement between an Xcert issuer and a recipient and an on-chain settlement of that agreement. So lets say that Alice is an Xcert issuer and Bob is the recipient. Alice and Bob come to an agreement that Alice will mint and send Bob an Xcert and Bob will pay for it in XCT Tokens. Now instead of Bob paying Alice in advance and then waiting for Alice to mint and send the token to Bob sometime in the future everything is done in a single atomic operation. 

## Motivation

There are multiple motivations behind the protocol minter. 

Firstly, the is trust. The minter provides a way to mint and exchange an Xcert for XCT tokens in a single atomic operation making the whole operation trustless. 

Secondly, there are simplicity and lower fees. The same result could be achieved if the issuer would mint a new Xcert to himself and then use the protocol trader to make the trade. But that would require more operations and overall higher blockchain fees. 

Thirdly, it is that the issuer can delegate the payment of blockchain fees to the recipient. With the protocol minter the recipient is the one who triggers the on-chain operation and by doing so is responsible for paying all the blockchain fees.

## Specification

The protocol minter is a smart contract that implements minting tokens in a trustless way. To provide this it uses several other components like blockchain signatures and proxy smart contracts. 

To make the minter smart contract upgrade-able the contract communicates through an additional proxy smart contract. This way we can change the minter contract that is responsible for the logic while proxies that have simple key functions stay the same. There are different proxies depending on the functionality. The protocol minter uses services of two different proxies. One is the Token transfer proxy that is responsible for transfering fungible tokens and the other is the Xcert mint proxy that can mint a new Xcert. 

A proxy is best explained as a smart contract that allows or rejects access to a key functionality and is controlled by a multisig wallet or a DAO. This way proxies can be trusted since they only allow access to smart contracts that were approved trough the DAO process.

The whole minting process has several steps.
1. The issuer and the recipient come to and agreement (off chain) that the issuer will create a specific Xcert for the recipient in exchange for XCT tokens.
2. The issuer makes blockchain signatures of the agreed data and sends the data used for the signature with public signature components to the recipient.
3. The issuer allows the Xcert mint proxy to mint in his/her name.
4. The recipient allows the Token transfer proxy to transfer his/her XCT tokens.
5. The recipient calls the minter with the data and signature information.
6. The minter performs an atomic operation which mints new Xcert to the recipient and transfers XCT tokens to the issuer.

If any step of the process is not correct the minter will not perform the operation. So if the recipient tries to change the data in a way that he/she would transfer less XCT tokens the operation would fail because the issuer's blockchain signature would not match with the data the recipient provided. If the issuer or the recipient would not allow proxies to operate in their name the operation would fail etc.

The data needed to perform a mint through the minter is:
* Xcert recipient address. 
* Xcert contract address.
* Id of the Xcert that will get minted.
* Proof of the Xcert that will get minted.
* Metadata uri of the Xcert what will get minted.
* Addresses to which Xcert recipient will need to pay fees. 
* Fee amounts that Xcert recipient will need to pay.
* Salt that will provide uniqueness to the hash (we recommend using current timestamp when creating claim).
* Timestamp that represents expiration date of the claim.
* Signature information.
