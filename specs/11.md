## Simple Summary

The protocol swapper allows trustless exchange of multiple different types of NFTokens for multiple different types of NFTokens and XCT tokens.

## Abstract

The protocol swapper uses a combination of an off-chain agreement between two parties that own NFTokens and an on-chain settlement of that agreement.

So lets say that Alice owns a NFToken that represents a very rare crypto flower collectable and name it GoldenROSE and is willing to trade it. Bob has two NFTokens that represent different rare crypto flowers lets name it Daisy and Tulip. He also has a NFToken representing an in-game object for a mobile game, lets name it GO. He offers Daisy, Tulip, GO and some XCT tokens in exchange for the GoldenRose. Alice plays the same game and she finds this a fair deal so she accepts it. Now instead of sending each NFToken separately and trusting the other party to send the agreed tokens back everything is done in a single atomic operation.

## Motivation

The main motivation is trust. If you want to swap tokens you need to either trust the other party to send the tokens or trust a centralized exchange. The swapper provides a way to exchange different types of NFToken for different types of NFTokens with the added option of XCT tokens in a single atomic operation, making the whole operation trustless.

## Specification

The protocol swapper is a smart contract that implements swapping different types of NFTokens for different types of NFTokens and XCT tokens in a trustless way. To provide this it uses several other components like blockchain signatures and proxy smart contracts. 

To make the swapper smart contract upgrade-able the contract communicates through an additional proxy smart contract. This way we can change the swapper contract that is responsible for the logic while proxies that have simple key functions stay the same. There are different proxies depending on the functionality. Protocol swapper uses services of two different proxies. One is the Token transfer proxy that is responsible for transferring fungible tokens and the other is the NFToken transfer proxy that is responsible for transferring non-fungible tokens.

A proxy is best explained as a smart contract that allows or rejects access to a key functionality and is controlled by a multisig wallet or a DAO. This way proxies can be trusted since they only allow access to smart contracts that were approved trough the DAO process.

The whole swap process has several steps.
1.  Both parties come to an agreement (off-chain) that party A will send an NFToken(s) to the second party in exchange for an NFToken(s) and optionally XCT tokens.
2. Party A makes the blockchain signature of the agreed data and sends the data used for the signature with public signature components to party B.
3. Party A allows the NFToken transfer proxy to transfer NFTokens in his/her name.
4. Party B allows the NFToken transfer proxy to transfer  NFTokens in his/her name and allows the token transfer proxy to transfer his/her XCT tokens.
5. Party B calls the swapper with the data and signature information.
6. The swapper performs an atomic operation which sends the NFTokens and XCT tokens to the agreed parties.

If any step of the process is not correct the swapper will not perform the operation. So if party B tries to change the data in a way that he/she would transfer less or different NFTokens the operation would fail because the first party's blockchain signature would not match with the data party B provided etc.

The data needed to perform a swap through the swapper is:
* Party A address.
* Party B address. 
* Array of NFToken contract addresses that party A is sending. 
* Array of NFToken ids that party A is sending. 
* Array of NFToken contract addresses that party B is sending. 
* Array of NFToken ids that party B is sending. 
* Addresses to which the party B will need to pay fees. 
* Fee amounts that the party B will need to pay.
* Salt that will provide uniqueness to the hash (we recommend using current timestamp when creating claim).
* Timestamp that represents expiration date of the claim.
* Signature information.
