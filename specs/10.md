## Simple Summary

The protocol trader allows trustless trading of NFTokens for XCT tokens.

## Abstract

The protocol trader uses a combination of off chain agreement between a NFToken seller and a buyer and on chain settlement of that agreement. So lets say that Alice is an NFToken seller and is selling it. Bob wants to buy it with XCT tokens. Alice and Bob come to an agreement that Alice will send the NFToken to Bob and Bob will pay for it in XCT Tokens. Now instead of Bob paying Alice in advance and then waiting for Alice to send the NFToken to Bob sometime in the future everything is done in a single atomic operation. 

## Motivation

The main motivation is trust. If you want to exchange tokens you need to either trust the seller/buyer to send the tokens or trust a centralized exchange. Trader provides a way to exchange a NFToken for XCT tokens in a single atomic operation making the whole operation trustless. 

Note: The same functionality can be achieved through protocol swapper but would cost more in blockchain fees. Since we believe that this type of trading will happen a lot it is suitable to have a seperate contract for it and with that lower fees and complexity.

## Specification

The protocol trader is a smart contract that implements trading NFTokens for XCT tokens in a trustless way. To provide this it uses several other components like blockchain signatures and proxy smart contracts. 

To make the trader smart contract upgrade-able the contract communicates through an additional proxy smart contract. This way we can change the trader contract that is responsible for the logic while proxies that have simple key functions stay the same. There are different proxies depending on the functionality. Protocol trader uses services of two different proxies. One is Token transfer proxy that is responsible for transfering fungible tokens and the other is NFToken transfer proxy that is responsible for transfering none-fungible tokens. 

A proxy is best explained as a smart contract that allows or rejects a key functionality to the trader and is controlled by a multisig wallet or a DAO. This way proxies can be trusted since they only allow access to smart contracts that were approved trough the DAO process.

The whole trading process has several steps.
1. The NFToken seller and the buyer come to an agreement (off chain) that the seller will send NFToken to the recipient in exchange for XCT tokens.
2. The seller makes blockchain signatures of the agreed data and sends the data used for the signature with public signature components to the buyer.
3. The seller allows NFToken transfer proxy to transfer the NFToken in his name.
4. The buyer allows Token transfer proxy to transfer his XCT tokens.
5. The buyer calls trader with the data and signature information.
6. The trader performs an atomic operation which sends the NFToken to the buyer and transfers XCT tokens to the seller.

If any step of the process is not correct the trader will not perform the operation. So if the buyer tries to change the data in a way that he/she would transfer less XCT tokens the operation would fail because sellers blockchain signature would not match with the data buyer provided. If the seller or the buyer would not allow proxies to operate in their name the operation would fail etc.

The data needed to perform a trade through the trader is:
* NFToken seller address.
* NFToken buyer address. 
* NFToken contract address. 
* NFToken id.
* Addresses to which the buyer will need to pay fees. 
* Fee amounts that the buyer will need to pay.
* Salt that will provide uniqueness to the hash (we recommend using current timestamp when creating claim).
* Timestamp that represents expiration date of the claim.
* Signature information.
