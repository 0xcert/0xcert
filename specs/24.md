## Simple Summary

A decentralized identifier uniquelly identifies an Xcert.

## Abstract

A [decentralized identifier](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) or simply a DID is a string format which uniquely identifies an Xcert on the blockchain.

## Motivation

An Xcert identification consists of multiple information. The 0xcert protocol uses DIDs to uniquely describe an asset on the blockchain as URI that can be resolved as a publicly available resource.

## Specification

All DIDs are defined as `did:xcert:{URI}`. The URI consists of multiple information joined with `/` following the sequence:

| Index | Include | Description
|-|-|-
| 0 | Always | Blockchain identifier (e.g. `ethereum`).
| 1 | Always | Xcert smart contract address.
| 2 | Always | Xcert token ID.
| 3 | When chainable | Xcert revision number (e.g. integer or `latest`).

## Example

A DID representing a common Xcert:

```
did:xcert:ethereum/0xb3775fb83f7d12a36e0475abdd1fca35c091efbe/100
```

A DID representing a chainable Xcert:

```
did:xcert:ethereum/0xb3775fb83f7d12a36e0475abdd1fca35c091efbe/100/latest
```
