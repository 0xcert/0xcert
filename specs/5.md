## Simple Summary

An Xcert proof is a cryptographic imprint of a digital asset.

## Abstract

An Xcert carries an imprint of a digital asset data. It is a cryptographic hash which serves as a decentralized proof of a digital asset on the blockchain.

## Motivation

A cryptographic proof is an imprint of asset data which at the same time ensures asset data confidentiality. This proof is used to verify the existence and authenticity of a digital asset. An asset can be verified only when the issuer or the token owner discloses asset information to a third-party.

## Specification

The process of converting digital asset data into a cryptographic proof is called "certification". Tokens that hold these cryptographic proofs are thus called certified tokens.

A data object of a digital asset gets certified by using a cryptographic function. The result of the cryptographic function is a hash which represents the proof of a digital asset. The issuer can use any cryptographic algorithm to create a proof. The algorithm must be safe and compliant with the GDPR (e.g. sha512).
