## Simple Summary

An Xcert can be chainable.

## Abstract

A chainable Xcert enables the issuer to append proofs which form token revision history.

## Motivation

Data of a digital asset can change over time. Replacing an already issued token with a new one is not always desirable because the token reference could be lost.
