## Simple Summary

An Xcert can be chainable.

## Abstract

A chainable Xcert enables the issuer to append proofs which form token revision history.

## Motivation

Data of a digital asset can change over time. Replacing an already issued token with a new one is not always desirable because the token reference could be lost. In which case there could be other tokens that are referencing a token which has been deleted. A better solution to deleting a token would be simply adding a new revision of a particular token, which does not change the general structure.
