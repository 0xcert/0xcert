## Simple Summary

An Xcert points to a publicly available metadata file with token details.

## Abstract

An Xcert on the blockchain does not include any publicly available information about an asset it represents. However, it carries an URI to a publicly available metadata file which provides token details and public data of an asset. 

## Motivation

Storing data on the blockchain could be expensive. Sometimes we would want to provide also dynamic data about a particular asset. Managing data directly on the blockchain would not scale. By exposing additional information about a token as an off-chain data file solves many problems and makes the system flexible and scalable.

## Specification

Each Xcert includes an URI to a publicly available metadata file. This data object is a specifically designed JSON object, which conforms to [RFC-7159](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) and follows the mapping format defined by the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org) specification.

The metadata object describes an Xcert token with `name`, `description` and `image` fields. The `meta` property holds technical information and the `data` field exposes public asset data.

The naming of JSON properties follows the [schema.org](http://schema.org/) specification when possible. This is to enable an easy way to convert a data into [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format. The convention also expects the JSON keys to be defined in alphabetical order.

Schemas are versioned according to the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) specification. If new fields are added to the schema and it stays backward compatible then the schema version should not change.

A metadata file is served through a secure HTTPS connection on the public web. The response returns data in `application/schema+json` content type. It also includes a [Link header](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader) pointing to JSON Schema definition file of the received metadata object. The JSON Schema definition varies based on the token capabilities and the asset it represents.

Metadata JSON Schema definition:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "description": "An Xcert metadata object.",
  "properties": {
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A description of an asset.",
    },
    "data": {
      "$ref": "https://digital-asset/schema/definition.json"
    },
    "image": {
      "format": "uri",
      "type": "string",
      "description": "An URI to the resource with mime type image/*. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive."
    },
    "meta": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "digestAlgorithm": {
          "description": "The output of a cryptographic function.",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "dateCreated": {
          "description": "Token creation date.",
          "format": "date",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "expires":{
          "description": "Token expiry date.",
          "format": "date",
          "type": "string"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "digestAlgorithm",
        "dateCreated"
      ]
    },
    "name": {
      "description": "A unique name of an asset.",
      "type": "string",
    }
  },    
  "title": "Metadata",
  "type": "object"
}
```

## Example

Metadata response:

```
