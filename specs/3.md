## Simple Summary

An Xcert can be burnable.

## Abstract

An issuer can enable users to burn the Xcert tokens they own. When a user burns a token it permanently removes it from his/her wallet and thus from the Xcert smart contract.

## Motivation

Some digital assets can become invalid over time. By making Xcerts burnable, a user can clean up his/her wallet by permanently removing these tokens.
